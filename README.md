### Hi there 👋

My name is James (He/His/Him) and I am a software engineer recently turned Acessible Auditor at Acessible360. I've worked as a software engineer in various roles but I've found the most joy in creating and seeing things built on the front end of things. I am currently exploring the intersection between front end developement and web accessbility with my new found role.

### When I'm not in front of a computer...

- 🚴 I've recently started cycling regularly as a hobby
- 🍳 Cooking and being in the kitchen is therapeutic for me
- 🤖 I love high fantasy/sci-fi shows and films
- 💬 Talk nerdy to me about MTG
